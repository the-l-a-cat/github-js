* Unsubscribe from an organization.
If you participate in a medium to large active organization, you may find yourself subscribe to
numerous repos frot that organization that you aren't really involved or immediately interested in. But unsubscribing from these may be tedious as there's no single button in GitHub Web UI.
This tiny script allows you to unsubscribe from the whole page of organization repos in a batch.
To execute, paste the code in JavaScript console in your browser, plug the right name in place of
'example_organization_name' and enjoy!
